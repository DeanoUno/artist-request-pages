      <h2 style="color: #7e22ce;">From Dean Winkelmann: Be Part of My New Music Tech Beta Test ðŸŽ¶</h2>

        <p>Hi {{First Name}},</p>

      <p>
        I hope this finds you well and thriving on the stage (or wherever the music takes you)! I'm reaching out because I'm launching something new that I think you'll appreciate â€” and Iâ€™d love for you to be part of the first wave.
      </p>

      <p>
        Iâ€™ve been quietly building a platform that lets live performers like us take <strong>song requests and tips directly from fans in real time</strong>, using just a simple mobile-friendly page. No app, no logins, no nonsense. Just scan a QR code, pick a song, tip if you want â€” done.
      </p>

      <p>
        Itâ€™s called <strong>rQuestify</strong>, and Iâ€™m inviting a few trusted fellow musicians to help beta test the system before it goes public. Since weâ€™ve worked together (or cheered each other on) over the years, you came to mind right away.
      </p>

      <h3 style="color: #7e22ce;">What you get as a beta tester:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Free setup</strong> (normally $50)</li>
        <li><strong>At least 3 months of free access</strong></li>
        <li>A custom request/tip page branded for you</li>
        <li><strong>Real-time notifications</strong> when someone sends a tip or requests a song</li>
        <li>Easy integration with Venmo, PayPal, or Square</li>
        <li>Just display your QR code â€” fans do the rest!</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 style="color: #7e22ce;">What I ask in return:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Try it out at some of your gigs</li>
        <li>Give honest feedback: what works, what doesnâ€™t</li>
        <li>Join 1 or 2 short check-ins if possible</li>
        <li>If you love it, tell your friends!</li>
      </ul>
        <p>
        Want to see it in action? <a href="https://sanibelsong.com/?artist=deanouno" style="color:#7e22ce; font-weight:bold;" target="_blank">Click here to check out my live request/tip page</a>. Yours would look similar â€” but with your name, image, and song list.
        </p>

      <p>Interested? Just reply to this email or text me. To get started, Iâ€™ll need:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Your preferred performer name</li>
        <li>A logo or promo photo (square or wide)</li>
        <li>A list of songs you take requests for</li>
        <li>Your preferred tipping platform(s)</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Iâ€™d be honored to have you on board as one of the first artists to help shape this. Letâ€™s make something awesome together.
      </p>

<p>
  All the best,<br />
